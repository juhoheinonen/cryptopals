# Cryptopals answers

- In this repository I store my advance in Cryptopals. 
- I decided to use C as the language for the exercises.
- I put solutions in separate folders which I may document below.
- I use make to build the solutions.
- I put under lib folder code that can be reused.
- I use bash scripts to perform some kind of unit tests.
