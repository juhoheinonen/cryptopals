# Cryptopals answers

- In this repository I store my advance in Cryptopals. 
- I decided to use C as the language for the exercises.
- I put solutions in separate folders which I may document below.
- I use make to build the solutions.
- I put under lib folder code that can be reused.
- I use bash scripts to perform some kind of unit tests.

## Advance

### Set 1.1:
- goal: convert hex to base64
- folder: 1_1_hex2b64			
- status: DONE

### Set 1.2:
- goal: fixed XOR
- folder: 1_1_xorhexstrings		
- status: DONE

### Set 1.3:
- goal: decrypt single-byte XOR cipher
- folder: 1_3_decr1bxor			
- status: DONE
- notes: algorithm could maybe be better

### Set 1.4
- goal: find one string in file that has been encrypted by single-character XOR
- status: DONE

### Set 1.5
- goal: implement repeating-key XOR
- status: DONE
- notes: test for decrepxor missing
